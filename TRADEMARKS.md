# QBitFlow Trademark Policy

This policy governs use of QBitFlow names, logos, and other brand assets
(“Marks”) in connection with the QBitFlow SDKs and related software.

1. **Ownership**

    QBitFlow, Inc. owns all rights, title, and interest in the QBitFlow Marks. The
    MPL-2.0 license does not grant any rights to use the Marks except to the extent
    necessary to reproduce factual copyright/license notices.

2. **Allowed Use**

    You may:

- Use the word “QBitFlow” to make factual, descriptive references to the
  unmodified, official QBitFlow SDKs as distributed by QBitFlow, Inc.
- Use screenshots or package names for purely descriptive, nominative fair use.

3. **Prohibited Use**

    You may not:

- Use QBitFlow Marks on modified builds of the SDKs, or in a manner that
  suggests QBitFlow produces, endorses, audits, or certifies your build unless
  you have written permission.
- Use confusingly similar names, logos, or domain names.
- Remove, alter, or obscure QBitFlow trademark notices in the official
  distributions.

4. **Compatibility and “Official” Badges**

    QBitFlow may publish conformance tests. Only builds that (a) are produced and
    signed by QBitFlow, or (b) pass the conformance tests and receive written
    authorization from QBitFlow, may use phrases like “official,” “QBitFlow
    certified,” or “compatible with QBitFlow” in marketing.

5. **Permissions**
   To request permission for broader mark usage, contact QBitFlow at the address
   provided on our website.

6. **Termination**
   QBitFlow may revoke permissions for misuse. This policy may be updated from time
   to time. Continued use after updates constitutes acceptance.
